- **Objective:** Creating a google extension widget that allows for users to see which of their favorite streamers is live on a variety of platforms.
- **Motivation:** In the dynamic world of online streaming, keeping track of multiple favorite streamers across various platforms can be a challenging task for avid fans. Streaming platforms such as Twitch, YouTube Gaming, Facebook Gaming, and others host a multitude of content creators, each with their own unique schedules and streaming habits. For fans who follow several streamers, the process of checking each platform individually to see who is live can be time-consuming and inefficient
